# Matrix-calculator

Can do matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It can also solve the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix. The program is quite simple and I might add more later. 
Requirements: Python 3 and Num.py library installed.
Recommendations: Use a IDE like repl.it, pycharm, or the Python 3 IDLE to run this.
